# crowdnalysis
 Crowdsourcing Citizen Science projects usually require citizens to classify items (images, pdfs, songs,&#8230;) 
 into one of a finite set of categories. Once an image is classified by different citizens, the different votes 
 need to be aggregated to obtain a consensus classification. Usually this is done by selecting the most voted category. 
 *crowdnalysis* allows Crowdsourcing Citizen Science projects to compute consensus that go beyond the selection of 
 the most voted category, by computing a model of quality for each of the citizen scientist involved in the project. 
 This more advanced consensus results in higher quality information for the Crowdsourcing Citizen Science project.

## Implemented consensus algorithms

  - Majority Voting
  - Probabilistic
  - Multinomial
  - Dawid-Skene
  
In addition to the pure Python implementations above, the following models are implemented in the 
probabilistic programming language [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) by using the 
`CmdStanPy` [interface](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy):
  - Multinomial
  - Multinomial Eta
  - Dawid-Skene
  - Dawid-Skene Eta Hierarchical

~ Eta models impose that the probability of the labels are higher for the real classes in the error-rate 
(a.k.a. confusion) matrix.

## Features
  - Import annotation data from a `CSV` file with a preprocessing option
  - Calculate inter-rater reliability with different measures
  - Fit selected model to annotation data and compute the consensus 
  - Compute the consensus with a fixed pre-determined set of parameters
  - Fit the model parameters provided that the consensus is already known
  - Given the parameters of a generative model (Multinomial, Dawid-Skene), sample annotations, tasks, 
  and workers (i.e., annotators)
  - Visualize the error-rate matrix for annotators 
  - Conduct predictive analysis of the accuracy vs. number of annotations for a given set of models
  - Visualize the consensus on annotated images in `HTML` format 
  

## Quick start

crowdnalysis is distributed via PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/crowdnalysis/](https://pypi.org/project/crowdnalysis/)

Install as a standard Python package:

`$ pip install crowdnalysis`

`CmdStanPy` will be installed as a dependency, however, this package requires the installation of the 
`CmdStan` command-line interface too. 
This can be done via executing the `install_cmdstan` utility that comes with `CmdStanPy`.
See the package [docs](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy/installation.html) for  more information.

`$ install_cmdstan`

Use the package in the code:

`import crowdnalysis`

Check available consensus models:

`print(crowdnalysis.factory.Factory.list_registered_algorithms())`

## How to run unit tests

We use [pytest](pytest.org) as the testing framework. Tests can be run by:

`$ pytest`

If you want to get the logs of the execution, do 

`$ pytest --log-cli-level 0`

## Logging 

We use the standard `logging` library according to the rules [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html).
